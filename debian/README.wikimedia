This debian/ directory was extracted from
https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/python-gevent/1.1~b1-0ubuntu2.
It was then added to a git clone from http://github.com/gevent/gevent.git
in a debian branch.

Changes from original source package:

- Modified gbp.conf
- Removed python3-greenlet-dbg build deb since it doesn't exist as a
  .deb package (yet?)
- Added cython, cython3 to Build-Depends
- Uncommented override_dh_auto_test to skip running tests
